        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <p>
          Answer all generic questions (where you were, purpose of the
          visit, profession, customs declarations, etc.) at primary
          screening at the border (the main booths that everyone goes
          to).
        </p>
        <h4>Secondary Screening</h4>
        <p>
          If you are sent to secondary screening (additional
          questioning besides the main booths), do the following and <b>state 5 things</b>:
          <ol>
            <li>I am an American citizen.</li>
            <li>I have identified myself.</li>
            <li>I want to speak to a supervisor.</li>
            <li>I want a lawyer. </li>
            <li>I feel I am being religiously profiled.</li>
          </ol>          
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">          
        <h4>Refuse</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Refuse to answer any questions about your:
            <ul>
              <li>political views</li>
              <li>religious practice or education</li>
            </ul>
            (if you answer, they'll probably hold you longer)
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not give your cell phone password.<br />
            <i>You do have to surrender your phone, but don't have to give your password.</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Insist</h4>
        Insist that they let you in. It is your right as an American
        citizen to be let into this country&mdash;no one can tell you
        otherwise.
        <h4>When released</h4>
        <p>
          Immediately contact CAIR (Civil Rights Department) to file a
          complaint:
          <ul>
            <li>Email <a href="mailto:civilrights@cair.com">civilrights@cair.com</a></li>
            <li>Call them at +1-202-742-6420</li>

      <div class="col-lg-6">        
        <h4>Do NOT Sign</h4>        
        <p>
          Do NOT sign the Form I-407, even if they say it will make
          things easier. That form is for deportation!

        <p>
          A <b>hearing</b> from an immigration judge.  Do NOT relinquish this right.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <b>attorney</b> as you have the right to representation.
          Ask to speak to an attorney and discuss details with them
          and NOT CBP.
        </p>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
